Recommendation: eliminate MedMoprh and IHE SDC on FHIR from F-CPDS
Add Observation for handling unstructured Pathology Observations
Change Bundle to Collection only
DiagnosticReport in the Collection Bundle should be 1..* - is current 1..1
Potential structure: 
Path Report Bundle
  DiagRep -- OBR + ORC
    presentedForm - eCP
  DiagRep
    OBSx - OBX 
  DiagRep
    OBSx

Need to include Procedure, ServiceRequest


A consideration is to separate SDC and make IHE SDC/eCP on FHIR only for Pathology Observations 
Or add Observations to F-CPDS

Refer to https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/uv-lab-rep-ig/ spec as potential option to reference - is currently based on the EU
- Have bundle structure 

Write up issues we've had with Observation Grouper in representing multi specimen. Include an example from NAACCR Vol V
