# 01 - CKey CodeSystem not available yet but will be
A definition for CodeSystem 'https://cap.org/eCC' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# 02 - This relies on 6.1.0 
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.cancer-reporting: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[1]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 7.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
WARNING: CodeSystem/cap-ecc-codesystem: CodeSystem.concept[0]: HL7 Defined CodeSystems should ensure that every concept has a definition

# 03 - This is a new warning and will be addressed by the workgroup during reconciliation
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.cancer-reporting: ImplementationGuide: HL7 Implementation Guides should state their maturity explicitly using the extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-fmm

# 04 - Proprietary Code system (from CAP) values are not found. CodeSystem URL (http://cap.org/eCC) identified in THO: https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-CAPeCC.html
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/cap-ecc-codesystem: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 06 - Deprecated pattern slicing from an inherited US Core profiles
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/us-pathology-diagnostic-report: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[12].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
