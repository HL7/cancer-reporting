# 01 - Code System example
 A definition for CodeSystem 'https://example.org' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# 02 - IG is using US Core 6.1.0 to keep in line with the anticipated (and regulated) version most implementers will support at time of publication
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.cancer-reporting: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[1]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent version is 8.0.0-ballot. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# 03 - This is a new warning and will be addressed by the workgroup during reconciliation
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.cancer-reporting: ImplementationGuide: HL7 Implementation Guides should state their maturity explicitly using the extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-fmm
